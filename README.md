Something Under The Bed
=======================

This is Something Under The Bed, a Javascript/jQuery game I devised and built for Halloween 2016 for Builtvisible. Design by Andrea Dona.

You can see the live game here: https://builtvisible.com/something-under-the-bed/

Quick start
-----------

Clone the repo and run 'npm run setup'. For all subsequent uses, just run 'gulp'.

Note, Windows users may need to run the initial command more than once for it to complete successfully.
